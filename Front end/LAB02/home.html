      <p>

            Hello everyone, my name is Narongchai Rongthong. I'm studying in CAMT second-year major in software engineer. I really enjoy writing codes it's quite fun and
        challenging for me and it feels really good to finally solves something. I studied in Montfort College and made a project using gms2 (game maker studio 2). 
        After that I've been taking my time learning to use gms2 during the rest of highschool.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            I also like to play games. I used to play a lot of FPS games such as, csgo, rainbowsix : siege, apex legends, titanfalls2. 
        Currently I've moved on from competitive FPS games and now got into modern tetris, peaked at #7 TH and retired from it. Afterwards, 
        I've been playing a lot of ADOFAI (a dance of fire and ice) which is a hardcore rhythm game with strict judgement. I'm currently the top #1 player of thailand in that game
        because I'm currently the only one that is able to submit a score.
      </p>
